"Who's Free?" — A handy tool for determining if it's a good time to reach out to someone.

What is it?

"Who's Free?" is a super simple tool.

You just need to paste a text message to find out if someone is currently sleeping, busy, or free, even if you're in different time zones.

It's not precise tracking, nor is it a schedule manager.

Its sole purpose is:

To save you from awkwardly bothering someone.

Why did I create this?

I often chat with online friends and acquaintances in different countries.

Every time I want to reach someone, I have to mentally convert time zones and guess if they're sleeping.

This tool is designed to "let the computer do the work."

# How to use it?

1️⃣ Open the tool

2️⃣ Paste settings like this:

gmt+8
sleep 23-8
busy 9-18

This means:

I am usually sleeping between 23:00 and 8:00 on GMT+8.

I am usually busy between 9:00 and 18:00.

3️⃣ Click "View Current Status"

You will immediately see the results:

Sleeping 😴

Busy 🟡

Free 🟢

The tool will automatically remember your settings, so you don't need to start over next time you open it.

# Who is it suitable for?

People with friends/online acquaintances in different time zones

People who don't want to manually calculate time differences

People who want to quickly know "is now a good time to chat"

《誰有空？》— 一個用來判斷「現在適不適合找對方」的小工具
這是什麼？

《誰有空？》是一個超簡單的小工具。
你只需要貼一段文字，就能知道某個人 現在大概是在睡覺、忙，還是有空，即使你們在不同時區。

它不是精準追蹤，也不是日程管理。
它的目的只有一個：

幫你少一次尷尬的打擾。

為什麼我會做它？

我經常和網友、朋友在不同國家聊天。
每次想找人，都要在腦中換算時區，猜對方是不是在睡覺。

這個工具，就是為了把這件事「交給電腦」。

# 怎麼用？

1️⃣ 打開工具
2️⃣ 貼上像這樣的設定文字：

gmt+8
sleep 23-8
busy 9-18


意思是：

我在 GMT+8

23:00 到 8:00 通常在睡覺

9:00 到 18:00 通常在忙

3️⃣ 點擊「查看當前狀態」

你會立刻看到結果：

睡覺 😴

忙碌 🟡

空閒 🟢

工具會自動記住你的設定，下次打開不用重來。

# 它適合誰？

有跨時區朋友 / 網友的人

不想再手動算時差的人

想快速知道「現在適不適合聊天」的人

# 目前狀態

這是第一個可用版本（MVP）。
